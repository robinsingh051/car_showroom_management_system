# CAR SHOWROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Handling the details of all the vehicles manually would be a
quite tedious job and may include a lot of errors, which in turn could 
lead to confusion in the data present. Thus to provide a smooth and 
error free functioning of an automobile showroom, we are creating 
this database management system to manage the data efficiently. 
Another motive is to be able to handle the customerâ€™s needs and 
requests efficiently, hence enhancing the service quality provided.

When the customers open the website, the list of the vehicles 
present in the showroom are presented to them. On clicking the one 
which the customers are interested to know more about, they are 
then taken to another page containing all of the vehicle details. After 
viewing multiple vehicles, the customer can schedule a test drive for 
the vehicle of their choice on the desired available time slot.

On the other hand, the admin i.e. who owns the showroom 
must handle all the customer requests and also provide accurate 
data to its staff and the customers. He can thus perform any 
operation on the data present in the database. The admin has all the 
rights be it to modify and make some changes in the data of cars available and salesmen or 
completely delete these data.
